//Shares-to-encryption is the protocol described in section IV.E.2 of the paper.
//Unlike the encryption-to-shares, no distinction is made between nodes: there is no master and slaves.
//Nodes first need to sample the CRS, which will be the degree-1 term of the final ciphertext.
//With the CRS, they produce a re-encryption share, which is an ordinary CKS share (with sk_input = 0)
//to which they sum delta*M_i (M_i being their initial additive share, in Z_t^n).
//The degree-0 term of the ciphertext is then the sum of the re-encryption shares.
